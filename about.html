        <h2><span>MEET THE BAND<span></h2>
        <p>After releasing their 2012 full-length debut Night Visions (featuring the Grammy Award-winning single “Radioactive”),
          Imagine Dragons spent nearly two years bringing their passionately inventive brand of alt-rock to arenas around the world.
          To deal with the chaos of a touring schedule that included 130 headline dates and 50 festivals across the globe,
          the Las Vegas-based quartet threw themselves into creating material for their next album. “So many things were changing
          for us so quickly, the only way to feel some kind of stability was to keep writing,” says frontman Dan Reynolds,
          who founded Imagine Dragons with guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. “Going
          up to my hotel room to work on new songs became something I looked forward to every night on tour,” Reynolds adds.
          “There were definitely a few times when the person next door’s banging on the wall because it’s 4 a.m. and they’re
          trying to sleep and I’m in there belting out some song I just wrote.” </p>

        <P>Despite the whirlwind of the past few years, the drive to create sonically adventurous but unabashedly honest music has
          remained a constant for Imagine Dragons. And for Reynolds—who recalls sneaking onto his older brother’s computer at age 13
          to use the recording software and sketch out songs about his early-adolescent heartache and frustrations—Smoke + Mirrors has
          proven his most daringly candid experience in songwriting yet. “At times it’s really scary to think about so many people hearing
          what I’m talking about in the lyrics on this album, but I know that for better for worse it’s completely authentic and genuine and
          true to who we are as a band,” says Reynolds. “And that’s the most important thing you can ever do as an artist, and also the most
          magical: forget about everyone and everything else for the moment, and just create whatever’s most meaningful to you.”</P>
